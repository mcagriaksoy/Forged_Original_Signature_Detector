# Forged_Original_Signature_Detector

This project checks whether the signature is a fake (forged) or not. The deep learning code, which compares the signatures it learns with the photo given to the system, can easily distinguish the signatures. This detector is using simply binary classification methods to detect forged or original signatures. 

# Introduction

As we know, signature is always important in our lives. We signing contracts, some important paper works etc. Signature is like finger print of us. The security of the signature is as important as the fingerprint security. That's why signature fraud has been burning people's head for years. In this program, if not a professional signature can be detected with real signature.
Besides, which of us was a student, we did sign for our friends. This project will prevent this situation also. :)
